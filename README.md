# React-Toggleable

**Notice** This is beta but already functional, documentation is missing.

Makes children toggleable between them.
Prety seful when you need to toggle between icons like toggle mic on and mic off.
```
  <Toggleable>
    <div> Mic On </div>
    <div Mic Off </div>
  </Toggleable>
```
